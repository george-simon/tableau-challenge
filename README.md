### Background
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program.

### Challenge
The challenge is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers to some of the below questions and complete the following tasks.
* Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
* Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you may merge multiple datasets from different periods.
    * 1 City Official Tableau Map
    * 2 Tableau Dashboards
    * 1 Tableau Story Board
* A text or markdown file with your analysis on the phenomenons you uncovered from the data.

### Considerations
Remember, the people reading your analysis will NOT be data analysts. Your audience will be city officials, public administrators, and heads of New York City departments. Your data and analysis needs to be presented in a way that is focused, concise, easy-to-understand, and visually compelling. Your visualizations should be colorful enough to be included in press releases, and your analysis should be thoughtful enough for dictating programmatic changes.
